This is the solution  for assignment-1



ass1.py contains the code.



I started with:-

taking an input string

converting it into binary

 again converting it into sha256 hash using the command <sha256.update(encoded_string)>

then a  loop for adding a numbers at the end of string and comparing the hash with the target hash

output for input "asap" :-

The proof of work was done in  1.6642305850982666 seconds
the target satisfying number appended to the string is  500702
